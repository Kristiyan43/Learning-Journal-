## Stuff I have learned 

16/02/2021 - I learned how to add fours to a riggedbody using float value.

16/02/2021 - The first time I made the jump pad was jumping off the ground.
The way I fixed it is by adding a public game object that the trigger enter will only affect.

16/02/2021 - When I made the elevator it was going only up but not coming down.
The way I made the elevator go down is by making the script every time he enters the elevator the script 
will tell the elevator to go to one of the targets I made. After the player enters the elevator again 
the elevator goes to the other target that I made.

16/02/2021 - The elevator was going up and down without the player being on top of it.
The way I fixed this problem is by making a public game object and every time the box collider
collided with the specified objects the code will send the elevator to its first target.

23/02/2021 - When I made the platform the player didn't stop fallen off it.
The way I fixed this is by making the scrip make the player a child of the platform so when the platform 
moves the player moves with it.

23/02/2021 - I learned how to make one object become a child to another object.

02/03/2021 - I was working on making a rotation object using quaternion but I couldn't make it work.
I asked Paul my teacher to show me how they work and with his help, I figured how to use them.
After that, I used them to make a rotating octagon and added numbers to each of the sides then I made a code
that can remember the side of the octagon and to assign a number to each of them.
